<h1>Chapter 15 - Improvement in Food Resources</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>1) Need for Increasing Food Production</h2>
<p>Our population is more than one billion and it is still growing. We will need more than a billion tonnes of grain every year to feed this growing population. Since increasing the area of land for cultivation is limited, it is necessary to increase the production efficiency of crops and livestock. The production efficiency of crops and livestock can be increased by adopting scientific management practices to improve crop yield, undertaking mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices like combining agriculture with livestock, poultry, fisheries, bee-keeping etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>2) Different Types of Crops</h2>
<p>Cereals like rice, wheat, maize, millets, sorghum etc. provide us carbohydrates. Pulses like peas, beans, grams, lentils etc. provide us proteins. Oil seeds like ground nut, sesame, castor, mustard, linseed, sunflower etc. provide us fats. Vegetables, spices and fruits provide us vitamins and minerals along with small amounts of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Fodder crops like berseem, oats or sudan grass are grown as food for livestock. Different crops require different climatic conditions, temperature and duration of sunlight (photoperiods).</p>
<p><strong>Kharif crops:</strong> crops grown during the rainy season from June to October like paddy, soyabean, maize, pigeon pea, green gram, black gram, cotton etc.</p>
<p><strong>Rabi crops:</strong> crops grown during winter season from November to April like wheat, gram, peas, mustard, linseed etc.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>3) Improvement in Crop Yield</h2>
<p>Crop yield can be improved by three main activities. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crop variety improvement</li>
<li>Crop production improvement</li>
<li>Crop protection management</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>4) Crop Variety Improvement</h2>
<p>Crop variety improvement is done by selecting good varieties of crops. This is done by hybridisation. Hybridisation is the crossing between genetically dissimilar plants to obtain crops having useful characteristics like disease resistance, good quality and high yields.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybridisation may be:
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li>Intervarietal (between different varieties)</li>
        <li>Interspecific (between different species of the same genus)</li>
        <li>Intergeneric (between different genera)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Another way of improving crop variety is by introducing a gene to obtain the desired characteristic. This produces genetically modified crops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crop variety improvement is done for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher yield: To increase productivity of crop per acre.</li>
<li>Biotic and abiotic resistance: To increase resistance of crops to biotic factors like insects, diseases etc. and abiotic factors like drought, salinity, heat, cold etc.</li>
<li>Change in maturity duration: To reduce the duration between sowing and harvesting so that farmers can grow multiple crops during the year.</li>
<li>Wider adaptibility: To grow crops in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Desirable agronomic characters: Characters like tallness and more branching are useful for fodder crops and dwarfness (shortness) is desirable for cereal crops.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>5) Crop Production Management</h2>
<p>Crop production management includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutrient management</li>
<li>Irrigation</li>
<li>Cropping management</li>
</ul>

<h3>a) Nutrient Management</h3>
<p>Plants get nutrients from air, water and soil. There are sixteen nutrients required by plants for their proper growth. Air supplies oxygen and carbon dioxide, water supplies hydrogen and the remaining thirteen nutrients are obtained from the soil. Among the sixteen nutrients required by plants, six are required in large quantities and are called macronutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and sulphur. The other seven are required in small quantities and are called micronutrients: iron, magnesium, boron, zinc, copper, molybdenum and chlorine.</p>
<p>Soil can be enriched by supplying nutrients in the form of manures and fertilizers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manure: prepared by the decomposition of plant and animal waste. It contains organic matter and nutrients. Helps to increase soil fertility. Types:
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li>Compost: decomposition in pits; vermicompost uses earthworms</li>
        <li>Green manure: green plants (sun hemp, gaur etc.) ploughed into soil before sowing</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Fertilizers: chemical substances supplying nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium; increase crop yield; excessive use reduces soil fertility and causes water pollution</li>
</ul>

<h3>b) Irrigation</h3>
<p>The supply of water to crops. Different systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wells: dug wells (water from shallow strata), tube wells (deep strata)</li>
<li>Canals: distribute water from reservoirs/rivers</li>
<li>River lift systems: lift water from rivers to nearby fields</li>
<li>Tanks: small storage reservoirs</li>
<li>Check dams: stop rainwater flow, increase groundwater, reduce soil erosion</li>
</ul>

<h3>c) Cropping Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mixed cropping: growing two or more crops together (wheat + gram, groundnut + sunflower)</li>
<li>Intercropping: alternate rows (maize + soybean, millet + cowpea); crops with different nutrient requirements</li>
<li>Crop rotation: growing different crops in succession; legumes after cereals increase soil fertility; can grow 2–3 crops profitably</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>6) Crop Protection Management</h2>
<p>Crops are damaged by weeds, insect pests and diseases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Weeds: unwanted plants (Xanthium, Parthenium, Cyperinus rotundus); compete with crops for nutrients, space, sunlight</li>
<li>Insect pests: damage roots, stems, leaves; suck sap; bore stems/fruits; reduce yield</li>
<li>Diseases: caused by pathogens like viruses, bacteria, fungi</li>
<li>Control: weedicides, pesticides, fungicides; sprayed or used for treating seeds/soil; excessive use causes pollution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grain Storage:</strong> damaged by biotic (bacteria, fungi, insects, rodents) and abiotic factors (moisture, temperature). Grains should be cleaned, dried, and storage fumigated.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>7) Animal Husbandry</h2>
<p>Scientific management of livestock including feeding, breeding, disease control. Includes cattle, sheep, goat, poultry, fish.</p>

<h3>Cattle Farming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Milch animals → milk; Draught animals → labour</li>
<li>Milk production depends on lactation period; can be increased by increasing period</li>
<li>Cross local (Red Sindhi, Sahiwal) with foreign (Jersey, Brown Swiss)</li>
<li>Feed: roughage (fiber) + concentrates (protein/nutrients)</li>
<li>Shelter: clean, ventilated, sloping floors</li>
<li>Diseases: parasites, bacteria, viruses; external → skin diseases; internal → stomach/intestine/liver; vaccination protects</li>
</ul>

<h3>Poultry Farming</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eggs → layers; meat → broilers</li>
<li>Cross Indian (Aseel) & foreign (Leghorn)</li>
<li>Feed: protein, vitamins, fats; hygiene, temperature, vaccination</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fish Production (Pisciculture)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Capture fishing: marine (pomphret, mackerel, tuna, sardines)</li>
<li>Culture fishery: freshwater/brackish; composite with paddy (rohu, catla, mrigal, grass carp, silver carp, common carp)</li>
<li>Marine farming: prawns, mullets, oysters; pearls from oysters</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bee-keeping (Apiculture)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Honey → energy & medicinal; Wax → medicinal & polishes</li>
<li>Bees: Indian, Rock, Little; Italian variety for large-scale</li>
<li>Bees collect nectar → convert into honey in hives; honey extracted with honey extractors</li>
</ul>
